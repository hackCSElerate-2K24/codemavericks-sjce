# 🚌 School Bus Tracking System 🚍

This web-based application is designed to help parents and school administrators track the real-time location of school buses. The system enables live tracking of buses on a map, provides updates on estimated arrival times, and sends automatic notifications in case of delays. It also allows school administrators to manage bus routes and make real-time adjustments as necessary.

## Features 🌟

- **Real-time Bus Location Tracking**: Parents can track the exact location of the school bus in real time on a map, using the GPS data from the bus driver’s mobile phone. 📍
- **Estimated Arrival Time**: The system calculates and displays the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the bus at specific stops. ⏰
- **Automatic Notifications**: Parents receive notifications if the bus is delayed or if there are any route changes. 📲
- **Route Management for Administrators**: School staff can manage bus routes and make adjustments in case of traffic or delays, sending updated information to parents. 🚦
- **Emergency Alerts**: In case of any emergency, the system can send alerts to the parents. 🚨
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for both parents and school staff. 💻
- **Basic Data Security**: The system includes basic data security to protect sensitive information such as student data and route details. 🔒

## Biometric Authentication 🔑

The system includes **biometric authentication** to ensure only authorized users (such as students) can board or deboard the bus. 📱

- **Fingerprint Scanning**: A mobile device equipped with a fingerprint scanner will be used to authenticate students when they board or deboard the bus. 🖐️
- **Enhanced Security**: This feature helps track attendance accurately and ensures only the right individuals are boarding the bus. 🔐
- **Student Verification**: Each student’s fingerprint is stored securely in the system, and the driver can verify the student’s identity before allowing them to board the bus. 👶

## Camera Monitoring 🎥

To enhance safety and security, the system integrates **camera monitoring** for the buses.

- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Cameras installed on the buses will provide live video feeds to the monitoring system. 👀
- **Student Safety**: The cameras help ensure that students are safe while traveling on the bus, offering an additional layer of monitoring. 🎬
- **Recordings for Review**: Video recordings can be stored and reviewed in case of any incidents or emergencies. 🎥

## How It Works 🔄

1. **Tracking**: The bus driver’s mobile phone, equipped with a GPS service, transmits the location data to the system. 📡
2. **Map Display**: The live location is displayed on a map in the web application. Parents can view where the bus is at any given moment. 🗺️
3. **Notifications**: The system calculates an estimated arrival time based on the bus's current location and updates parents with any changes. ⏳
4. **Route Management**: Administrators can update bus routes in case of delays or changes, sending real-time alerts to parents. 🛠️
5. **Emergency Alerts**: In case of an emergency or other critical event, the system sends alerts to parents immediately. ⚠️
6. **Biometric Authentication**: When students board or deboard the bus, their fingerprint is scanned for authentication. 🖐️
7. **Camera Monitoring**: The system monitors live footage from cameras installed on the bus and alerts if suspicious activity is detected. 🎥
